- **Agent**: A specialized AI component with a specific role (e.g., BOM Generator, Code Generator)
- **Orchestrator**: The routing agent that determines which specialist agent handles each user request
- **Artifact**: A generated project document (BOM, code, wiring diagram, etc.)
- **Chat_Session**: A persistent conversation between user and agents
- **Tool_Call**: An agent's invocation of a system function to update artifacts
- **Drawer**: A UI panel that displays specific artifact types
- **Amazon_Bedrock**: AWS managed service providing foundation models (Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Claude 3 Opus)
- **DynamoDB**: AWS NoSQL database service with streams for real-time updates
- **AWS_AppSync**: AWS managed GraphQL service for real-time subscriptions
- **Amazon_S3**: AWS object storage service for file uploads (circuit photos, datasheets)
- **AWS_Lambda**: AWS serverless compute service for API endpoints
- **AWS_Amplify**: AWS hosting and CI/CD service for the Next.js application
