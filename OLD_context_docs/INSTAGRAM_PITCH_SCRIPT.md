### **0:00 - 0:05 | THE HOOK (The Pain)**
**(Visual: Fast cuts of a messy desk, someone pulling hair over a datasheet, smoke rising from a breadboard 💥)**

**AI Voice:**
"Ever smell that 'magic smoke' when you plug in a circuit? 😱 That’s the smell of a project dying. We all know hardware is HARD. Datasheets are boring, voltage mismatches are silent killers, and wiring? It’s a nightmare."

### **0:05 - 0:15 | THE ORIGIN (The Idea)**
**(Visual: A "Lightbulb" moment graphic, then transitioning to the sleek dark-mode Ohm Interface 🌙)**

**AI Voice:**
"We asked: Why do software devs get all the cool tools while hardware engineers are stuck reading PDFs from 1998? We wanted a 'Ctrl+Z' for real life. So we built **Ohm**."

### **0:15 - 0:25 | THE SOLUTION (Enter Microsoft Azure)**
**(Visual: Logos of Microsoft Azure, OpenAI, and Computer Vision popping up over the Ohm UI ☁️)**

**AI Voice:**
"Ohm is the world’s first AI Hardware Orchestrator, powered entirely by the **Microsoft Azure AI stack**. 🚀 We’re using Azure OpenAI’s reasoning models to act as your personal engineering team."

### **0:25 - 0:45 | THE FEATURES (The Magic)**
**(Visual: Screen recording of Ohm in action. 1. Chatting about an idea. 2. The Wiring Diagram appearing. 3. Code streaming in.)**

**AI Voice:**
"Watch this: You basically text Ohm, *"I want a smart plant waterer."* 🪴
Boom. 💥
Ohm picks the EXACT compatible parts.
It draws you a **color-coded wiring map** so you literally can’t mess it up.
And the best part? It writes **production-ready firmware** tailored to YOUR specific wiring."

### **0:45 - 0:55 | THE VERIFICATION (The "Wow")**
**(Visual: Someone holding a phone camera up to a breadboard. A green "CHECK" mark overlays the screen ✅)**

**AI Voice:**
"Built it wrong? No worries. We use **Azure Computer Vision** to inspect your physical circuit through your camera BEFORE you power it on. It’s like having a senior engineer looking over your shoulder."

### **0:55 - 1:00 | OUTRO**
**(Visual: OHM Logo pulsing. Text: "The Path of Least Resistance." Link in Bio.)**

**AI Voice:**
"From back-of-the-napkin to working prototype in minutes. This is Ohm. The path of least resistance. ⚡️ Link in bio!"
