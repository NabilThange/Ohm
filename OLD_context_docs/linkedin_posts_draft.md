# LinkedIn Content Calendar: Project Ohm Teasers (14 Days)

**Strategy:** Focus on specific pain points in the electronics/hardware prototyping workflow. For each day, highlight a struggle, then drop a subtle "sneak peek" or hint that you are building a solution for that specific problem. The tone is "Building in Public" but guarding the "Secret Sauce".

## Week 1: The Foundation & The Friction

### Day 1: The "Blank Page" Problem (Feature: Idea/Orchestrator)
**Theme:** The difficulty of starting.
**Content:**
Starting a new electronics project is effectively 80% planning and 20% panic. You have this vague idea—"I want to build a smart plant monitor"—but turning that into a concrete roadmap is exhausting. You need to define the scope, the features, the power constraints.
I've been working on a way to turn that "what if" into a "how to" instantly. Imagine having a partner that helps you scope out the MVP before you even open a browser tab.
**Sneak:** Helping you bridge the gap between "Idea" and "Plan" without the headache.

### Day 2: The Datasheet Abyss (Feature: Specs/Docs)
**Theme:** Information overload.
**Content:**
Is there anything more soul-crushing than reading through a 400-page datasheet just to find the pinout for a $2 sensor? The information is there, but finding it feels like an archaeological dig.
Spending today making sure that we never have to CTRL+F through a PDF again just to find voltage logic levels.
**Sneak:** What if the relevant info just found you?

### Day 3: The Component Hunt (Feature: Parts Picker)
**Theme:** Sourcing chaos.
**Content:**
"Out of Stock." Three words that ruin every hardware engineer's week. You design a perfect board, only to find the MCU is on a 52-week lead time. Or you pick a part that’s EOL (End of Life).
Why isn't there a smarter way to select components that checks availability and compatibility *while* you design?
**Sneak:** prototyping a logic that picks parts that actually exist.

### Day 4: Budget Shock (Feature: Budget Manager)
**Theme:** Cost estimation.
**Content:**
Hardware projects have a nasty habit of doubling in cost when you aren't looking. You think it’s a $50 build, but then you add connectors, distinct power regulators, PCB shipping... and suddenly it's $150.
Trying to solve the "Budget Blindness" today.
**Sneak:** Real-time cost tracking as you design. No more surprises at checkout.

### Day 5: The "Spaghetti" Phase (Feature: Wiring Diagrams)
**Theme:** Connections and Routing.
**Content:**
We've all been there: staring at a breadboard that looks like a bowl of pasta, trying to remember if the blue wire goes to Ground or 5V. One wrong move and you let the magic smoke out.
Visualizing connections clearly shouldn't take hours of drawing in archaic tools.
**Sneak:** Working on something that untangles the mess before you cut a single wire.
**Tags:** #Wiring #Breadboard #CircuitDesign

### Day 6: The Firmware Gap (Feature: Code Generator)
**Theme:** Hardware vs. Software skills.
**Content:**
The classic divide: You have the circuit built perfectly, but the firmware refuses to compile. Or maybe you're a great coder, but the hardware logic is fuzzy.
Bridging the gap between "It's wired" and "It's alive" is the hardest part of the last mile.
**Sneak:** Trying to make the code write itself based on how you wired it.
**Tags:** #EmbeddedSystems #Firmware #Coding

### Day 7: The Organization (Feature: BOM Management)
**Theme:** Keeping track of chaos.
**Content:**
Spreadsheets. So many spreadsheets. One for parts, one for pinouts, one for to-do lists. Managing the BoM (Bill of Materials) is the least sexy part of engineering, but it crashes the most projects.
Time to kill the spreadsheet.
**Sneak:** Centralizing the chaos into one dynamic view.

## Week 2: The Intelligence & The Flow

### Day 8: The "Second Pair of Eyes" (Feature: Vision/Verification)
**Theme:** Debugging mistakes.
**Content:**
Sometimes you stare at a circuit for hours and can't see the mistake. You're convinced it's right. Then a colleague walks by and says, "Hey, your LED is backwards."
We don't always have that colleague nearby. But what if we did?
**Sneak:** Teaching a system to "see" your mistakes so you don't have to debug for hours.
**Tags:** #Debugging #ComputerVision #HardwareHelp

### Day 9: The Verification (Feature: Circuit Verification)
**Theme:** Confidence.
**Content:**
The anxiety before you power on a board for the first time is real. "Will it explode?"
Checking validity against datasheets manually is prone to human error. Automating that check is the dream.
**Sneak:** Building a safety net for your designs.
**Tags:** #SafetyFirst #ElectronicsDesign #QualityAssurance

### Day 10: Instructions & Walkthroughs (Feature: Step-by-Step Guides)
**Theme:** Documentation.
**Content:**
Building is one thing. Explaining how to build it is another. Writing documentation acts as a bottleneck for sharing open-source hardware.
Imagine if the documentation was generated *alongside* the project, not as an afterthought.
**Sneak:** Auto-generated walkthroughs.
**Tags:** #OpenSourceHardware #Documentation #HowTo

### Day 11: The Team (Feature: Multi-Agent Collaboration)
**Theme:** Specialized agents.
**Content:**
In a real engineering firm, you have a Parts guy, a Board Layout guy, and a Firmware guy. In a solo project, you have to be all three (and usually fail at one).
Experimenting with a workflow where "agents" handle the specific domains, just like a real team.
**Sneak:** A digital engineering team in a box.

### Day 12: Speed (Feature: Time-to-Prototype)
**Theme:** Acceleration.
**Content:**
The time between "Aha!" moment and "It works" is when enthusiasm dies. If we can compress 2 weeks of research and parts sourcing into 20 minutes, the innovation rate skyrockets.
That's the metric I'm obsessing over right now: Time-to-First-Prototype.
**Sneak:** Hitting the fast forward button on hardware dev.
**Tags:** #Velocity #Innovation #Speed

### Day 13: Accessibility (Feature: User Friendly/No-Code aspects)
**Theme:** Lowering the barrier.
**Content:**
Electronics shouldn't just be for EEs with 10 years of experience. The barrier to entry is still too high—datasheets are dense, compiler errors are cryptic.
We need tools that speak human, not just hex.
**Sneak:** Making hardware feel as intuitive as asking a friend for help.
**Tags:** #StemEducation #Democratization #TechForAll

### Day 14: The Vision (Summary)
**Theme:** The "Why".
**Content:**
For the last two weeks, I've been dropping hints about the friction points in hardware design—from the datasheet headaches to the wiring messes.
I'm building something to fix *all* of it. Not just a tool, but a complete ecosystem for bringing ideas to life.
It's an ambitious goal, but the early tests are promising.
**Sneak:** Stay tuned. The way we build electronics is about to change.
