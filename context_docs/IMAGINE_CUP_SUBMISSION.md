## D&I Integration
**Prompt:** How has your team considered Diversity & Inclusion (D&I) in your problem definition and solution design? (up to 100 words)

**Answer:**
Ohm is designed to democratize hardware engineering, a field often gated by expensive education and dense technical jargon. By using a conversational interface and plain language, we lower the barrier to entry for creators from non-technical backgrounds. Our "Vision Inspector" assists users with visual discrepancies, aiding those who may struggle with complex diagrams or small components. We explicitly designed Ohm to empower software developers, under-resourced students, and hobbyists to build physical solutions for their communities without needing a formal engineering degree, fostering a more diverse generation of hardware innovators.
