# Ohm - Pitch Deck Outline & Script
**Theme:** The Path of Least Resistance

---

## Slide 1: Title Slide
**Visual:** Large, clean Ohm logo. Tagline: "Bridging the Gap Between Software and Silicon."
**Subtitle:** An AI-Powered Hardware Orchestrator.
**Presenter (Nabil):** "Hello, I'm Nabil Thange, and I'm here to present Ohm—the path of least resistance for hardware development."

## Slide 2: The Problem (The "Datasheet Wall")
**Visual:** A split screen. Left side: "The Dream" (A cool sketch of a gadget). Right side: "The Reality" (Messy wires, confusing datasheets, 'Magic Smoke', compile errors).
**Text:** 
- High Barrier to Entry
- Fragmented Workflow (Datasheets vs. IDE vs. CAD)
- "Magic Smoke" (Costly Errors)
**Script:** "We've all had great hardware ideas. But the moment you try to build them, you hit a wall. You're drowning in 500-page datasheets, worrying about voltage mismatches, and debugging wiring errors. Usually, the project dies before it even starts."

---

## Slide 3: The Solution (Ohm)
**Visual:** A sleek UI shot of Ohm. The chat interface, the 'Success Units', and the Wiring Diagram.
**Text:** Your AI Co-Pilot for Hardware. From Idea to Prototype in Minutes.
**Script:** "Enter Ohm. It’s not just a chatbot; it’s an intelligent workspace that guides you from a back-of-the-napkin sketch to a production-ready prototype. It handles the boring stuff—compatibility checks, wiring maps, and boilerplate code—so you can focus on the innovation."

## Slide 4: The Secret Sauce (Multi-Agent Architecture)
**Visual:** A diagram showing the "Sequential Assembly Line". 
- 🧠 *The Visionary* (Ideation)
- 📐 *The Systems Engineer* (Blueprint & BOM)
- 💻 *The Firmware Developer* (Coding)
- 👁️ *The QA Inspector* (Visual Verification)
**Script:** "What makes Ohm unique is its Multi-Agent Architecture powered by Azure. It mimics a real engineering firm. One agent helps you brainstorm. Another locks down the engineering specs. A third writes the firmware, and a fourth uses Computer Vision to verify your actual physical wiring. It's a sequential assembly line for ideas."

## Slide 5: The Demo (The "Wow" Moment)
**Visual:** [Video Clip Placeholder]
1. User types "I want a smart plant monitor."
2. Ohm selects parts (ESP32, Soil Sensor).
3. Ohm shows the wiring diagram.
4. Ohm generates the Arduino code.
**Script:** "Let's see it in action. I ask for a smart plant monitor. Ohm instantly selects the right sensors, ensuring voltage compatibility. It draws me a color-coded wiring map. And finally, it writes the firmware specifically for this wiring. In 60 seconds, I have a blueprint that would have taken me days to research."

## Slide 6: Market & Impact (Democratization)
**Visual:** Icons representing Students, Software Devs, Hobbyists.
**Text:** 
- Empowering the "Software-First" generation.
- Reducing E-Waste (Get it right the first time).
- Accelerating Edu-Tech.
**Script:** "We are targeting the millions of software developers and students who want to build hardware but are intimidated by the complexity. By democratizing this access, we're not just building tools; we're enabling a new wave of physical innovation."

---

## Slide 7: Why Azure?
**Visual:** Logos of Azure OpenAI, Azure Computer Vision.
**Text:** 
- Best-in-class Reasoning (GPT-4o / o1-mini)
- Enterprise-grade Security
- Scalable Vision capabilities
**Script:** "Ohm is built entirely on the Azure AI stack. We leverage the reasoning power of o1-mini for complex logic checks and GPT-4o Vision for checking user circuits. Azure gives us the reliability to turn a hobbyist tool into a professional engineering assistant."

---

## Slide 8: The Team
**Visual:** Photo of Nabil. Background showing code/hardware.
**Text:** Nabil Thange - Solo Founder & Full Stack Engineer.
**Script:** "I'm Nabil, a solo founder with a passion for embedded systems. Ohm is the tool I wished I had when I started. It puts the power of a full engineering team into the hands of a single creator."

---

## Slide 9: The Ask / Closing
**Visual:** Large QR code to the GitHub/Demo. "Start Building Today."
**Script:** "Hardware shouldn't be hard. With Ohm, we're making it the path of least resistance. Thank you."
