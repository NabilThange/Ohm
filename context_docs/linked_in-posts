to be active on linkedin should i keep giving updates on the IDEA/PROJECT ..i am currently working on ?11:01 AMNot necessarily — and it can actually backfire if you're not careful.
Here's how I'd think about it:
When project updates work well:

You're building in public and want accountability or feedback
The updates show progress and learning, not just "still working on it"
You're in a field where thought leadership matters (SaaS, startups, consulting)
Each update offers genuine value or insight to your audience

When they don't:

You're posting vague teasers without substance ("big things coming!")
You're sharing the same idea repeatedly without demonstrating execution
You're in a competitive space where ideas can be copied
Your audience doesn't care about incremental progress — they want outcomes

Better alternatives to consider:

Share lessons learned or challenges overcome while building
Post about relevant industry trends or problems you're solving
Engage meaningfully with others' content in your space
Save the big reveal for when you have something concrete to show

A practical approach:
Mix it up. Maybe share occasional milestones that demonstrate real progress, but balance with other valuable content — insights from your field, commentary on trends, helpful resources. This keeps you active without becoming repetitive or giving away too much.
What field are you in, and what stage is your project at? That might help me give more specific advice.but this idea of mine is new and unique..and i am afraid ..that someone might copy it11:02 AMThen don't share the specifics publicly — especially on LinkedIn where your network includes competitors, potential copycats, and people you barely know.
Here's the reality: if your idea is truly valuable and you're not yet in a position to execute quickly or protect it, broadcasting it on LinkedIn is risky. Ideas spread fast, and execution beats ideation every time. Someone with more resources, connections, or speed could run with your concept before you do.
What you can do instead to stay active on LinkedIn:

Share around your idea, not the idea itself

Post about the problem space you're exploring
Discuss industry gaps or pain points you've noticed
Share learnings from your research or customer conversations


Build your credibility in the domain

Comment thoughtfully on others' posts in your space
Share relevant articles with your take
Write about trends or challenges in your industry


Network strategically offline

Have 1-on-1 conversations with potential advisors, customers, or partners
Use NDAs when discussing specifics with people who could help
Build relationships that matter without broadcasting everything


Wait until you have momentum

Once you have a prototype, early customers, or traction, you're harder to copy
Then you can share your journey from a position of strength



Being active on LinkedIn doesn't mean revealing your competitive advantage. You can be present, valuable, and visible without giving away what makes your project unique. Save the details for when you're ready to launch or when you've built enough of a moat that copycats won't matter.
What matters more right now — LinkedIn visibility or protecting your idea while you execute?like my idea was.. an AI TOOL FOR ELECTRONICS PURPOSE.. which brainstorms your idea,make mvp,prd,make a budget, selectes components , gives wiring diagram , may help via vision if you are stuck in wiring , gives codes , and instructions to run it.. and each task has it's own agent ... so this is also a multi-agent system11:04 AMOkay, so here's my honest take: this is a good idea, but it's not as unique as you might think — and that's actually liberating for you.
Why you shouldn't worry too much about it being copied:

Similar tools already exist or are being built - There are already AI coding assistants, hardware design tools, and even some emerging multi-agent systems for electronics. Your specific combination might be unique, but the concept of "AI assistant for electronics projects" is in the zeitgeist.
Execution is everything - Plenty of people have ideas for multi-agent systems. What matters is:

How well your agents actually work together
The quality of your component recommendations
How accurate your wiring diagrams are
Whether your vision model can actually debug real-world circuits
Your UX and how seamless the workflow is


The technical challenges are significant - Building this well requires deep expertise in electronics, AI/ML, agent orchestration, vision models, and understanding the maker/engineer workflow. Most people who hear the idea won't have the skills to execute it properly.

What you should do:
Build fast, share selectively:

Stop worrying about the idea being stolen and start executing rapidly
Share your progress with potential users (makers, hobbyists, engineers) to get feedback — they're your allies, not competitors
Don't share detailed technical architecture publicly yet

Use LinkedIn strategically:

Post about problems in electronics prototyping without revealing your solution
Share insights like "talked to 20 hardware engineers this week about their biggest pain points"
Engage with the maker/electronics/AI communities
When you have an MVP, then announce it boldly

Focus on what actually matters:

Getting a working prototype
Talking to real users and refining based on their needs
Building something that genuinely works better than duct-taping together ChatGPT + existing tools

The hard truth: if someone with resources wanted to build this, they probably already are. Your advantage isn't secrecy — it's speed, domain expertise, and building something people actually want to use.
So should you post about it on LinkedIn? Maybe occasional vague updates about "building in the hardware AI space," but save the details for launch. Right now, user conversations and shipping matter way more than LinkedIn engagement.what all things can be shared on linkedin ? which are not to much to make the other side understand the idea of my project !!... give me example ~5-6 post example.. all in sequence ..like day 1 , day 2 [maybe has context from day 1], day 3 [context from 1,2], day 4 [something new], 5 , 611:06 AMHere's a 6-post sequence that builds curiosity and credibility without revealing your solution:

Day 1: Problem Statement (Relatable Pain Point)
"Spent 3 hours yesterday debugging why my Arduino circuit wasn't working.
Turns out I had the servo motor wired to the wrong pin.
For hardware engineers and makers, this is just Tuesday.
We have AI that writes essays and generates art, but prototyping electronics still feels like the Wild West — trial, error, and a lot of burned components.
There's got to be a better way."

Day 2: Market Insight (Shows You're Researching)
"Talked to 15 electronics hobbyists and hardware engineers this week.
The pattern is clear:
→ Idea to working prototype takes 3-5x longer than it should
→ 60%+ of time is spent on 'grunt work' — component selection, wiring, debugging silly mistakes
→ Most give up before seeing their idea come to life
The electronics prototyping workflow hasn't evolved much in 20 years, even as AI has transformed software development.
Curious: What's the most frustrating part of going from idea to working hardware for you?"

Day 3: Personal Story (Builds Connection + Context from Day 1-2)
"My first electronics project was a disaster.
I wanted to build a smart plant watering system. Simple enough, right?
Spent ₹5,000 on components I didn't need, fried two microcontrollers because I misread a datasheet, and the 'MVP' took me 6 weeks instead of the 2 I planned.
But here's what stuck with me: the idea was simple. The execution was chaos.
That gap between 'I want to build this' and 'here's my working prototype' is where most hardware ideas die.
After talking to makers and engineers (thanks to everyone who responded yesterday!), I'm realizing this isn't just my problem — it's systemic.
What if we could compress that timeline from weeks to days?"

Day 4: Emerging Trend (Something New — No Direct Connection)
"Multi-agent AI systems are quietly becoming the next big shift.
Instead of one AI doing everything poorly, you have specialized agents:

One handles research
Another writes code
Another reviews and debugs

Each agent has a narrow expertise, and they collaborate to solve complex problems.
We're seeing this in software dev tools, customer service, even medical diagnostics.
Makes me wonder: what other domains are ripe for this approach?
Where else do we have complex workflows that require multiple types of expertise working together?"

Day 5: Vision Without Details (Aspirational)
"Imagine this workflow:
You describe your electronics project idea in plain English.
Within minutes, you get:
→ A complete component list with budget breakdown
→ Wiring diagrams tailored to your specs
→ Starter code ready to flash
→ Step-by-step assembly instructions
And when you inevitably get stuck during assembly, you snap a photo and get instant debugging help.
Hardware prototyping at the speed of thought.
Is this sci-fi? Or closer than we think?
Building in this space has me optimistic it's the latter."

Day 6: Call to Action (Building in Public Teaser)
"I'm building something in the electronics + AI space.
Not ready to share details yet, but I'm looking to talk to:
→ Hardware engineers who prototype regularly
→ Makers/hobbyists working on Arduino/Raspberry Pi projects
→ Educators teaching electronics
15-minute conversation, just want to understand your workflow and pain points better.
If that's you (or someone you know), drop a comment or DM me.
Let's make hardware prototyping less painful. 🛠️"

What this sequence does:

Establishes the problem space without revealing your solution
Shows you're doing research (credibility)
Builds narrative tension and curiosity
Positions you as someone "building" without giving away the how
Ends with a clear CTA that helps you gather user insights

Timing: Don't post all 6 consecutively. Space them out over 2-3 weeks, mixing in engagement with others' content between your posts.
Does this style work for you, or want me to adjust the tone?still the post looks revealing ..if someone reads them..they might get the idea about what i am building !!11:08 AMYou're absolutely right. Let me tone it down significantly — make it way more generic so no one can piece together your specific solution:

Day 1: Generic Problem (Could Apply to Any Domain)
"Why does prototyping hardware still feel stuck in 2005?
Software devs have autocomplete, code suggestions, debugging assistants.
Hardware engineers? Still manually reading datasheets and breadboarding by trial and error.
The gap is wild."

Day 2: Personal Struggle (Vague, Relatable)
"Burned through my weekend debugging a circuit.
The issue? One wrong resistor value.
Three hours to find a problem that took 30 seconds to fix.
There has to be a better workflow."

Day 3: Industry Observation (Totally Generic)
"Interesting pattern I'm noticing:
AI tools are emerging for lawyers, doctors, designers, marketers.
But engineers building physical products? Still largely manual processes.
Seems like an overlooked opportunity."

Day 4: Random Insight (Unrelated to Your Project)
"Multi-agent systems are fascinating.
Instead of one AI trying to do everything, you have specialized agents working together — each good at one thing.
Seeing this approach pop up in software development, customer support, research.
Wonder what other fields could benefit from this."

Day 5: Building Momentum (Zero Specifics)
"Started working on something new in the hardware space.
Early days, lots to figure out.
But the more people I talk to, the clearer the problem becomes.
Excited to see where this goes."

Day 6: Vague CTA
"Looking to chat with hardware engineers and makers about their workflows.
Just trying to understand pain points better — 15 min conversation, no sales pitch.
If you work with electronics/prototyping and want to vent about what's broken, DM me. ☕"

Honestly though? Even these are arguably too revealing if you're truly worried about copycats.
Here's the real question: If you're THIS concerned about protecting the idea, maybe LinkedIn posting isn't the right move right now at all.
Alternative approach:

Stay quiet on LinkedIn until you have a working MVP
Network privately (DMs, emails, offline conversations)
Build relationships without broadcasting
Launch publicly only when you're ready to compete

You can stay "active" on LinkedIn by just commenting on others' posts, sharing general industry news, or posting about completely unrelated topics. You don't need to talk about your project to maintain presence.
What matters more to you right now — LinkedIn visibility or protecting your idea while you build?
